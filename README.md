This repository encapsulates all the libraries I've made for 3D rendering, This is the only code in this graphics pipeline that is not really modular, this sort of acts as glue code for the other components of the engine, providing some composite structs for encapsulating parts of the engine and some useful functionalities that for some reason did not feel right to include in the more independent submodules of this engine.

Demos/implementations can be found in the [GrahpicsEngineImplementations](https://github.com/HD787/GraphicsEngineImplementations) repo
